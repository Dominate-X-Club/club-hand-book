### Notes on Implementation

1. **OAuth Integration**: Use Twitter's OAuth to handle authentication. This will allow users to sign in or sign up using their Twitter credentials without needing to create a new password.
2. **Consistent Branding**: Maintain consistent branding across the login and sign-up pages to reinforce brand recognition.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the pages are responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. **Minimalist Design**: Keep the design clean and uncluttered to make the process as straightforward as possible.

By focusing on a simple and seamless integration with Twitter, users will find it easy to join and start using the Dominate X Club platform.
