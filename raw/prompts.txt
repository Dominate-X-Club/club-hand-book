At [@dominateXclub](https://x.com/dominatexclub), we strive to build an unparalleled capitalist, democratic community of independent digital nomads, co-operatively act as a tech unicorn ðŸ¦„.

so for the community want i want to build is a place where a freelancer could act as a team member of a larger organization. i.e he can have the benchstrength without hiring many people. there are training session where he can up skill and also teach other people. they get certiifcates (badges) (like L1 in react means this guys knows a bit about react while L10 may mean he's a master) when they clear certain levels of a subject. we use these badges as proof of skill/competance to the clients. we use bounties as proof of work. so a client could give out bounties to our club which our members complete to earn and learn. we also take up whole projects, any member of the club can take a project from market, introduce it to club members and then they work together to complete the project. this removes the need to hire or be hired. so as naval ravikant says, that he sees 8 billion companies now. due to tech this has been possible. we are a group of #digital nomads who stick together to act as a company. we host regular spaces to meet up, and educate. we believe in apprenticeship model

explain this in simpler terms

also introduce that many of us are active influencers on twitter and other platform. atleast our mentors are. and are members want to do that. we want to use that influence for our sponsor to do marketing for them. sponsors and hiring partners use us to find and train the best full time and part time talent. we also keep working on our open source projects. where we pay contributors and maintainers with bounties. in a 60:40 split. we use money generated from these open source projects to fund activities of the club. sponsors pay us as a retainer. and we use their money in a 80:20 split to market them:general club actitities.

so this is a free for all system. win-win-win for everyone. for training we do live classes with question answer session. we also record these sessions for later viewing. we also urge our members to create training content which they can offer for free for the club or can have a business model around their content. but we urge people to use the club as top of the funnel for any of their business model.

or content creators its also a very good opportunity to test even if people want to see what they are creating. so their effort is very less, they have to just take a lecture we gather the audience and branding for them
