1. Yes, I'm working on my club called DominateX Club.
2. Let's do one thing, I'll speak in Hindi, and you can reply in English. I don't speak fluent English, so let's talk in this way, okay?
3. So, what is DominateX Club?
4. Let me tell you a bit about myself first. I have previously worked at a multinational services company called Nagetan. Then, I also ran my own startup.
5. In my valuable experience, I noticed that when you run a large company, it's easier to handle similar projects for clients. But as freelancers, it becomes challenging. I want to discuss these challenges. For example, one main issue is the workbench. When you are pitching to clients and you pick up a project, suppose the client says they need a WordPress site. If you don't have a WordPress developer, what will you do? In a big company, you can just tell the manager or the team, and they'll align someone from the bench to the project. As a freelancer, this is not possible. We want to solve these issues with the club. Plus, in a multinational company, every hired person is assigned projects efficiently, which freelancers lack.
6. We've just started. We sit on Twitter Spaces every night at 8 PM and have a Discord server. I'm also working on a website with a landing page to explain the club, and later, there will be an app with profiles, badges, and more. I'm also working on a GPT project, feeding it all the information. Can you give me a transcription of our conversation to plug into the other GPT?

**Assistant:**
1. That sounds intriguing! What's the focus of DominateX Club?
2. Absolutely! You can speak in Hindi, and I'll reply in English. That way, we can communicate comfortably.
3. DominateX Club sounds interesting. Could you explain what it is?
4. Thatâ€™s impressive! Having experience in a multinational company and running a startup is quite valuable. Is DominateX Club part of your startup or a separate project?
5. I understand. You're saying that large companies have resources that freelancers often lack, and your club aims to provide those resources to freelancers and small businesses. This is a great idea! Are you planning any specific tools or platforms for this initiative?
6. Got it. You're starting with Twitter Spaces and a Discord server, and working on a website with a landing page to explain the club. Later, you'll have an app with profiles, badges, and more. You're also working on a GPT project. I'll provide the transcription of our conversation in a document format for you to use in your GPT. Here is the text data of our conversation and what I understand about your club.
