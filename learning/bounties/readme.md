## #DominateBounty: Earn & Learn with Rewarding Challenges

**Welcome to DominateBounty!**

Here, you can **hone your skills, test your knowledge, and get rewarded** for your hard work by participating in exciting bounty challenges. DominateBounty is an integral part of Dominate X Club, but you don't need to be a member to join the party!

**How Bounties Work:**

* **Bounty Creators:**
    * The Dominate X Club can create bounties from its funds for various purposes:
        * **Open-Source Contributions:** Encourage valuable contributions to open-source projects.
        * **Content Creation:**  Spark the creation of high-quality assets or marketing materials for the club.
        * **Other Initiatives:**  Support various initiatives that benefit the Dominate X Club community.
    * **Sponsors:**  Companies or individuals sponsoring Dominate X Club can leverage bounties to:
        * **Promote their Projects:** Advertise their projects and attract skilled talent.
        * **Boost Marketing Efforts:**  Generate creative marketing materials to reach new audiences.   
     * **Individuals:**  Anyone can create a bounty! However, a non-sponsor fee of 7% of the total bounty amount will be charged by the club to cover administrative costs.
* **Bounty Hunters:**
    * Look for bounty challenges within your chosen learning track or explore opportunities across various skillsets.
    * Each challenge will provide a detailed description, difficulty level, and a cash prize pool of **$5 and above**. 
    * Complete the challenge effectively to earn a **certificate** recognizing your accomplishment. 
    * The participant with the **best overall performance** wins the **top cash prize** and an additional **special certificate**. 

**Creating Bounties (Current Process):**

1. To propose a bounty, reach out to **[Abhinav Singhal](x.com/umunbeing)** or email **contact@umun.in**. 
2. In the future, bounty creation will be seamlessly integrated within the Dominate X Club app.

**Bounty Promotion:**

* Dominate X Club will actively promote bounties on **Twitter** and **Discord** through official channels. 
* We plan to expand promotion to **LinkedIn** in the near future.
* To maximize reach, participants are encouraged to share updates on their **Twitter** profiles, referencing the original bounty post. This not only showcases your skills but also promotes the Club and/or sponsor!

**Bounties as Proof of Work:**

Successful bounty completion serves as a valuable **"Proof of Work"** for freelancers.  Combine this with your **"Proof of Skill"** ([Dominate X Club badges](./../learning/readme.md)) to create a compelling profile that impresses potential clients and employers.
