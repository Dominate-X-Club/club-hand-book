### Story: The Tale of Two Chefs
Imagine two chefs running restaurants in Mumbai. Chef A and Chef B both have delicious recipes, but they have very different approaches to sharing them.

**Chef A (Closed Source Chef):**
Chef A keeps his recipes a secret. He believes that his success depends on keeping his culinary secrets safe. His recipes are like the Coca-Cola formula or KFC's secret blend of herbs and spices.

**Chef B (Open Source Chef):**
Chef B, on the other hand, believes in sharing his recipes with the world. He uploads his recipes to a public repository on GitHub. He believes that by sharing his recipes, he can collaborate with other chefs, get feedback, and continuously improve his dishes.

**Benefits:**

| Benefit        | Description                                                                                          | Chef Example                                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Monetization**| Easier to monetize and protect intellectual property.                                                | Chef can sell packaged products or franchise his restaurant.   |
| **Security**   | Potentially more secure since the code is not publicly accessible.                                    | Competitors would take years to reverse engineer his recipes.  |

| **Dependence**     | Users rely on the company for updates and bug fixes.                                               | Customers have to wait for the chef to create new dishes.      |
