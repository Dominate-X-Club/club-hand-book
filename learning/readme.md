## Mentors

For each subject we need a few mentors and teachers.

### Founding Mentors

The mentors who will introduce a subject, create the curriculam and assign other mentors

## Curriculum 
We shall understand what the depth of a subject is, and then divide it into modules and then classes.

## Live classes
One of the mentors takes up live classes with questionares, these classes complete up a curriculam

## Content to read/watch
We shall record the live classes and create content. For the content, we still dont have our own content, we shall find out third party content, to create a wholistic picture

## Certification Levels/Grading
For each module/level of the subject, we shall provide certification, which are decided by the founding mentors. The test for the same could be a MCQ, one on one interview, some assignment, this shall be decided by the founding mentor.

## Time Table
To teach these subjects, we should actually create a time table.
