### Case Study: From Freelancer to Agency Success – Prakrati's Journey with Dominate X Club

**Background:**
[Prakrati](https://x.com/aryaprakrati), a BBS graduate from Mumbai University, began her career in a startup before transitioning to [Schbang](https://schbang.com), one of India's most renowned social media and marketing agencies. With extensive experience in marketing and social media, Prakrati had observed the process of website development and the intricacies of digital marketing.

**Challenge:**
Embarking on her entrepreneurial journey, Prakrati founded her own marketing agency, OneMore. Her first major client, an NGO, initially sought help with social media but soon needed a website. Although Prakrati had exposure to website projects, she lacked hands-on experience in completing one independently.

**Solution:**
Recognizing the need for expertise, Prakrati turned to the Dominate X Club, a thriving community of digital nomads and freelancers. She collaborated with [Abhinav Singhal](https://x.com/umunbeing), a seasoned agency owner and club member with over a decade of experience. Abhinav guided Prakrati through the client onboarding process, introduced her to the basics of WordPress, and provided crucial advice on pricing and preparing premium service models. He helped her with price discovery, ensuring she offered competitive and value-driven pricing.

**Execution:**
Leveraging the club’s daily sessions at 8 PM, where members share insights and project suggestions, Prakrati created initial website components using a Figma template recommended by fellow members. She shared her designs publicly using the hashtag #buildinpublic, inviting the entire community to provide suggestions and feedback. This collaborative approach transformed her solo freelance journey into a supportive group effort.

**Outcome:**
With support from Abhinav and the broader community, Prakrati successfully delivered a high-quality website to her client. The client was delighted with the outcome, and the project’s success highlighted the unique value of Dominate X Club – providing the benefits of a large tech company through a community-driven approach.
